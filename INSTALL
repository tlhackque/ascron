To install ascron:

Make sure Perl is installed.

The latest release will be posted at https://github.com/tlhackque/ascron

Obtain a release tarball and verify its signature, e.g.:
  wget https://github.com/tlhackque/ascron/releases/download/V1.0.11/ascron-1.0.11.tar.gz
  wget https://github.com/tlhackque/ascron/releases/download/V1.0.11/ascron-1.0.11.tar.gz.sig
  gpg --verify ascron-1.0.11.tar.gz.sig

unpack tarball, e.g.:
  tar -xzf ascron-1.0.11.tar.gz
cd to the directory

The Perl module Time::ParseDate is not required, but is highly recommended.
It can be istalled from your distribution (e.g. perl-Time-ParseDate or
libtime-parsedate-perl), or from cpan (cpan install Time::ParseDate).

make install                # to /usr/local
make install prefix=/opt    # to /opt

DESTDIR=/staging            # to /staging/usr/local

To uninstall:

make uninstall              # Use the same overrides as make install

To rebuild man page (from pod, requires pod2man from Pod::Man):

make

To commit an edit:

 - Update version in ascron.

 - make && git commit -m"..." && make dist && git push --tags


To make tarballs (kittypes compression(s))  with signature using default gpg key:

make dist

To make targalls with signature using a specific gpg key(s)

make dist key="xxxxxxxx yyyyyyyy"

To make only gz and xz (any file type recognized by tar -a can be used)

make dist kittypes="gz xz"

To make tarballs without signature

make unsigned-dist

To remove tarballs and packaging directory for current version:

make clean

Any make that creates a tarball will tag HEAD if:
  - From a working directory and
  - The git command is available and
  - The working directory is clean and
  - The version of ascron is not alreay tagged.
