.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIascron\fR runs a command in the environment it would have if run by (Vixie) \fIcrond\fR, without
the difficulties of editing a \fIcrontab\fR and waiting for \fIcrond\fR to notice it.
.PP
\&\fIascron\fR can select jobs from any installed \fIcrontab\fR (user or system), from an uninstalled
\&\fIcrontab\fR, or can run a job defined on the command line.
.PP
\&\fIascron\fR sets up the environment using the same process as \fIcrond\fR does when reading \fIcrontab\fRs.
.PP
\&\fIascron\fR obeys the same enviroment variables as \fIcrond\fR for determining the \s-1SHELL, PATH,\s0 and output
disposition.
.PP
Additionally, \fIascron\fR allows the job's output to be sent to stdout, e\-mail, or discarded,.  E\-mail
is sent exactly as \fIcrond\fR would, obeying the crontab's environment variables.
.PP
When running jobs, \fIascron\fR will (if run as root) run them as the appropriate user, setting the job's
\&\fB\s-1UID\s0\fR, \fB\s-1GID\s0\fR, and groups as specified.
.PP
See \fB\s-1EXAMPLES\s0\fR for how these interact.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following options are used to select the \fIcrontab\fR(s) searched, and the job to be run.
.PP
\&\fBsystem\fR \fIcrontabs\fR include the user under which a job runs.  These include \fI/etc/crontab\fR and \fI/etc/cron.d/*\fR.
\&\fBuser\fR \fIcrontabs\fR do not include the user.  The user is implied by the Icrontab>'s location or by the \fB\-\-format\fR option.  The user may also be specified by the \fB\-\-user\fR option, which also implies a default table.
.PP
Options contained in \fI~/.ascron\fR will be applied before any specified on the command line.  The \fB\-\-no\fR forms of options may be useful on the command line to override \fI~/.ascron\fR.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR \fB\-\-debug\fR=\fIfile\fR \fB\-\-nodebug\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d --debug=file --nodebug"
Writes a detailed log of processing events to \fIfile\fR.  \fIfile\fR may be '\-' for \fIstderr\fR.
.Sp
While intended for debugging \fIascron\fR, some of the detail may be helpful for understanding how \fIcron\fR processes a job.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fB\-\-[no]detach\fR \fB\-\-[no]daemon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D --[no]detach --[no]daemon"
\&\fIascron\fR daemonizes itself before running the job.  This frees your terminal when executing long-running jobs, and is how \fIcrond\fR runs.
.Sp
This does not affect \fB\-\-debug\fR output if \fIstderr\fR is specified.
.Sp
Ues \fB\-\-pidfile\fR if you want to capture the \s-1PID\s0 of the daemon.
.Sp
Consider placing \fB\-\-detach\fR in your \fI.ascron\fR if long-running jobs are the norm.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fB\-\-format\fR=\fIautomatic|system\fR|\fIuser\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f --format=automatic|system|user"
Specifies the format of the \fIcrontab\fR(s) read by the command.
.Sp
\&\fIautomatic\fR, the default, determines the format using \fB\-\-table\fR, \fB\-\-user\fR, and/or \fB\-\-job\fR.
.IP "\fB\-j\fR \fB\-\-job\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j --job"
Specifies the job(s) to be located in the \fIcrontab\fR(s).  The command arguments are unanchored regular expressions that match each \fIcrontab\fR command.  If more than one argument is specified, they are combined with \fIor\fR; that is, a command is selected if any of the arguments matches.  By default, the first matching command will be used, but \fB\-\-match\fR can specify a subsequent match.
.Sp
If \fB\-\-job\fR is not specified or \fB\-\-nojob\fR/\fB\-\-command\fR/\fB\-c\fR is specified, the command is specified by the command line arguments.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR \fB\-\-[no]list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l --[no]list"
With \fB\-\-job\fR, lists all matching jobs (and does not execute any).  Useful with multiple matches to determine a value of \fB\-\-match\fR that will select the desired job.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR \fB\-\-mail\-action\fR=\fIdiscard\fR|\fIdisplay\fR|\fIsend\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M --mail-action=discard|display|send"
Output on \fIstdout\fR or \fIstderr\fR from \fIcron\fR jobs is (usually) e\-mailed; the destination, source, subject, and format are controlled by environment variables set in the \fIcrontab\fR.
.Sp
By default, \fIascron\fR faithfully emulates this behavior \*(-- which can be inconvenient for debugging jobs.  \fB\-\-mail\-action\fR can override the default action so that the mail message is displayed (on \fIstdout\fR) or discarded.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR \fB\-\-pidfile\fR=\fIfile\fR \fB\-\-nopidfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p --pidfile=file --nopidfile"
Write the \s-1PID\s0 of the job to \fIfile\fR as \fIj:<pid\fR>.
.Sp
When daemonizing, also write the \s-1PID\s0 of the daemon to \fIfile\fR as \fId:<pid\fR>.  The order of the PIDs is unpredictable.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR \fB\-\-table\fR=\fIfile\fR \fB\-\-notable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t --table=file --notable"
Selects the \fIcrontab\fR file used to extract environment variables, and (with \fB\-\-job\fR) the command.
.Sp
Note that without \fB\-\-job\fR, the job defined on the command line is processed as if it is located at the end of the \fIcrontab\fR.  Thus, if an environment variable is re-defined in a \fIcrontab\fR, the last definition is used.
.Sp
If not specified or defaulted, all system tables are read.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fB\-\-user\fR=\fIname\fR \fB\-\-nouser\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u --user=name --nouser"
Specifies the username to be matched when locating a job or table; under which the job executes.
.Sp
If \fB\-\-table\fR is not specified, \fB\-\-user\fR implies the user's private table.
.Sp
If a username is required, but not determined implicitly or by \fB\-\-user\fR, the username is obtained from the opertor's (effective) \fI\s-1UID\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fB\-\-match\fR=\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m --match=n"
Specifies that the \fIn\fRth matching job is to be used.  The first (and default) match is numbered 1.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR \fB\-\-tz\fR=i<zone>  \fB\-Z\fR \fB\-\-notz\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z --tz=i<zone> -Z --notz"
\&\fIcrond\fR implementations vary considerably in whether jobs have \fB\s-1TZ\s0\fR (the timezone) in their environment, and if they do, where it comes from and what it contains.
.Sp
\&\fIascron\fR attempts to set \fB\s-1TZ\s0\fR from its environment, or failing that from several system commands and files.
.Sp
To specify the value of \fB\s-1TZ\s0\fR for \fIascron\fR jobs, use \fB\-\-tz\fR=\fIzone\fR, where \fIzone\fR can be any string (but should be what your \fIcrond\fR provides).
.Sp
To omit \fB\s-1TZ\s0\fR, use \fB\-\-notz\fR.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR \fB\-\-locale\fR=\fIspecifier\fR \fB\-\-nolocale\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L --locale=specifier --nolocale"
Specifies the locale from which the default codeset for e\-mails is determined.  See Subtleties, below for details.
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Displays the version number of \fIascron\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Displays the help sections of the manual.
.IP "\fB\-\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "--man"
Displays the manual.
.SH "Subtleties"
.IX Header "Subtleties"
There are two things that \fIascron\fR can't or doesn't emulate.
.SS "Locale considerations"
.IX Subsection "Locale considerations"
By default, the operator's locale is used to determine the default codeset for e\-mail and by commands directly executed by the \f(CW\*(C`SHELL\*(C'\fR.
However, \fIcrond\fR runs as a daemon, and \fIascron\fR can't determine what locale it would use.  The operator's locale
is used since there's a reasonable chance that it is also the system default, and the \f(CW\*(C`C/POSIX\*(C'\fR locale is out of favor.
.PP
However, \f(CW\*(C`LC_COLLATE\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR for compatibility with \fIcrond\fR.
.PP
To get the right results for your system, you can run \fIascron\fR \f(CW\*(C`LC_ALL=fr_FR ascron ...\*(C'\fR, or use \fB\-\-locale\fR.
.PP
If \f(CW\*(C`LC_*\*(C'\fR environment variables are set in tables, they apply to (subsequent) jobs.
.SS "Multi-level security"
.IX Subsection "Multi-level security"
\&\fIcrond\fR identifies its jobs to MLS-equipped systems (e.g. \s-1SELINUX, APPARMOR\s0) so that they get the correct security contexts assigned.
.PP
\&\fIascron\fR does not support this.  You may see different behaviors as a result.
.SH "\fIstdin\fP for \fIcron\fP jobs"
.IX Header "stdin for cron jobs"
If a \fIcrontab\fR command contains an unquoted '%', everything after the first unquoted '%' is sent to the job's \fIstdin\fR.
Any subsequent unquoted '%'s are converted to newlines ('\en'), and if the input does not end in a newline, one is added.
Quoting is with backslash ('\e'); only '%' and '\e' may be quoted; in any other case, both the backslash and the following
character are passed-through.
.PP
If a \fIcrontab\fR command does not contain an unquoted '%', \fIstdin\fR is attached to \fI/dev/null\fR.
.SH "Mail from \fIcrond\fP"
.IX Header "Mail from crond"
Determining how and when e\-mail is sent by \fIcrond\fR requires a careful reading of documents and code.  This is how \fIascron\fR
implements it (some text borrowed from \fIcrond\fR's \fIman\fR pages:
.PP
\&\fIcrond\fR (and thus \fIascron\fR) may send e\-mail when a job generates output on \fIstdout\fR or \fIstdin\fR.
.PP
In addition to \fB\s-1LOGNAME\s0\fR, \fB\s-1HOME\s0\fR, and \fB\s-1SHELL\s0\fR, \fBcron\fR\|(8) looks at the \fB\s-1MAILTO\s0\fR variable if a mail needs to be sent as a  result  of
running any commands in that particular crontab.  If \s-1MAILTO\s0 is defined (and non-empty), mail is sent to the specified address.
If \fB\s-1MAILTO\s0\fR is defined but empty (\fBMAILTO=""\fR), no mail is sent.  Otherwise,  mail  is  sent  to  the  owner  of  the crontab.
.PP
If \fB\s-1MAILFROM\s0\fR is defined (and non-empty),  it is used as the envelope sender address, otherwise, ``\fBroot\fR'' is used.
.PP
\&\fBNote:\fR  Both  \fB\s-1MAILFROM\s0\fR  and \fB\s-1MAILTO\s0\fR variables' values are expanded using the \fIcrontab\fR's environment, so setting them as in
the following example works as expected:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    MAILFROM=cron\-$USER@cron.com ($USER is replaced by the system user)
.Ve
.PP
By default, cron sends a mail using the '\fIContent-Type:\fR' header of '\fItext/plain\fR' with the '\fIcharset=\fR' parameter set  to  the
\&'charmap/codeset' of the locale in which \fBcrond\fR\|(8) is started up, i.e., either the default system locale, if no LC_* environment
variables are set, or the locale specified by the LC_* environment variables (see \fBlocale\fR\|(7)).
.PP
Different  character  encodings  can  be used for mailing cron job outputs by setting the \fB\s-1CONTENT_TYPE\s0\fR and
\&\fB\s-1CONTENT_TRANSFER_ENCODING\s0\fR variables in a crontab to the correct values of the mail headers of those names.
.PP
If defined, \fB\s-1MAILSUBJECT\s0\fR can be used to provide a custom \fISubject\fR header.  It is subject to expansion with the following
variables (but not environment variables):
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%cmd\fR%        \- expands to the job's command line
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%forkstatus\fR% \- expands to \fIsuccess\fR or \fIfailure\fR according to \fIascron\fR's ability to fork a child process to run the command
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%fqdn\fR%       \- expands to the fully qualified domain name of the host.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%hostname\fR%   \- expands to the first \*(L"word\*(R" of the hostname
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%status\fR%     \- expands to \fIsuccess\fR or \fIfailure\fR according to the commands exit status
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\f(CW%user\fR%       \- expands to \fB\f(CB$USER\fB\fR
